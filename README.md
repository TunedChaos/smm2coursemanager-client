## Common Issues
- The loading screen is taking a long time
  - Just be patient it should finish
- No really, I see the main screen but loading is still taking forever!
  - Oh! That means you probably don't have the right server address
- But I do!
  - Probably not, double check your server address, put it into a web browser, if the server address isn't currently showing a current and next status (even a non-status) then your address isn't right.
